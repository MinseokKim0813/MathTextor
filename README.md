## **Key Achievements & Findings**

**MathTextor** significantly bridges the gap between the speed of handwriting and the professional quality of $\\LaTeX$. In a user study with **24 undergraduate participants**:

* **38.63% Faster:** For slower typists (novices), MathTextor was nearly 40% faster than standard $\\LaTeX$ typesetting.
* **Easier to Learn:** Demonstrated a significantly gentler learning curve and higher ease-of-use scores compared to traditional methods.
* **Higher Accuracy:** Users reported higher notation accuracy and fewer syntax errors.
* **Lower Cognitive Load:** Participants found the tool less distracting, allowing them to focus on mathematical concepts rather than coding syntax.

## **Abstract**

Mathematical writing presents a significant challenge for students due to its complex notation and strict formalism. Two major obstacles are the steep learning curve associated with mastering mathematical typesetting languages (such as $\\LaTeX$) and the considerable time investment required to produce professional, math-heavy documents.

**MathTextor** is an AI-powered writing interface designed to humanize digital mathematical writing. It integrates a contextual AI component to automatically suggest relevant mathematical symbols based on the problem context, reducing the need for rote memorization of syntax.

## **Key Features**

* **Contextual AI Support:** Automatically suggests relevant mathematical symbols based on the current writing context.
* **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Minimizes the need for users to memorize complex $\\LaTeX$ commands.
* **Hybrid Workflow:** Designed to bridge the gap between the speed of handwriting and the professional formatting of $\\LaTeX$.
* **Error Reduction:** Automated suggestions lead to higher notation accuracy.

## **Research & Evaluation Methodology**

We evaluated the system through a controlled user study comparing three distinct methods:

1. Handwriting (Baseline)
2. Standard $\\LaTeX$ Typesetting
3. MathTextor

### **Detailed Results**

| Metric | MathTextor Performance |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Speed (Novice Users)** | **38.63% faster** than standard $\\LaTeX$ |
| **Learning Curve** | High (Easy to Learn) |
| **Ease of Use** | Significantly higher than $\\LaTeX$ (Likert scale 1-7) |
| **User Preference** | Larger area of positive user experience (vs. $\\LaTeX$) |
